# Car Driving Game

## Project Overview

This project is a simple interactive game where the user controls a car to navigate around obstacles and reach the target. The game features user-friendly controls, collision detection with obstacles, win/lose scenarios, and additional enhancements like texture and realistic lighting effects.

## Scenario

- **User Controls**: Utilize up, down, right, and left keys to drive the car in various directions. The car and camera move together for a seamless gaming experience.

- **Obstacles**: Four randomly distributed cubes serve as obstacles. Colliding with an obstacle stops the car, displaying a 'You Lose !' message for 3 seconds before resetting the game to the initial state.

- **Target**: If the car reaches the target, it stops, and a 'You Win !' message appears for 3 seconds. The game resets to the initial state for the user to start over.
